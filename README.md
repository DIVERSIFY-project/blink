Blink
=============

Welcome to the Blink repository!  
Here, you will find the complete source code of our project.  
If you want to know more about Blink, follow [this link](https://breaklinkability.github.io/blink/).  
If you are interested in building your own Blink virtual machine, go [here](https://github.com/breaklinkability/blink/wiki).  

How to launch Blink?
-------

In order to launch Blink, you need :  
* the Blink directories on your hard drive (you can extract the zip file that is at the root of this repository to do it)
* a populated database of fonts, plugins and browsers
* a pool of virtual machines completely configured for Blink (go [here](https://github.com/breaklinkability/blink/wiki)for details if you want to create your own Blink virtual machines)

Then, when everyhing is ready, you can start Blink and you can synthesize a new browsing environment by launching the **mainHost.py** script located at the root of your own Blink directory (Python 3 and Python3-numpy required).  
For Fedora : `sudo yum install python3 python3-numpy`  
For Ubuntu/Debian : `sudo apt-get install python3 python3-numpy`
