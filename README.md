Blink
=============

Welcome to the Blink repository!  
Here, you will find the complete source code of our project.  
If you want to know more about Blink, follow [this link](https://breaklinkability.github.io/blink/).  
If you are interested in building your own Blink virtual machine, go [here](https://github.com/breaklinkability/blink/wiki).  

How to launch Blink?
-------

In order to launch Blink, you need:  
* the Blink directories installed on your hard drive (To do so, you can extract the zip file that is at the root of this repository)
* a populated database of fonts, plugins and browsers
* a pool of virtual machines completely configured for Blink (For details relating to the creation of your own Blink virtual machines, click [here](https://github.com/breaklinkability/blink/wiki))

Then, when everything is set up, you can start Blink and you can synthesize a new browsing environment by launching the **mainHost.py** script located at the root of your own Blink directory (Python 3 required).  
For Fedora: `sudo yum install python3`  
For Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install python3`
